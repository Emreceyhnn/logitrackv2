/**
 * Route deviation (anomaly) detection.
 *
 * A planned route is stored as an encoded polyline (`Route.shape`). Around that
 * centre line sits a corridor of half-width `Route.bufferMeters`. A GPS ping
 * outside the corridor is "off-route".
 *
 * A single off-route ping is not an anomaly: GPS drift, tunnels and multi-path
 * error in urban canyons routinely throw a fix hundreds of metres off. So an
 * alert requires DEVIATION_CONSECUTIVE_PINGS successive off-route pings, and
 * fires once per excursion — the vehicle must return to the corridor before a
 * new alert can be raised for the same route.
 *
 * Excursion state lives in Redis, keyed per route+vehicle. It is disposable:
 * losing it re-arms the detector (worst case, one duplicate alert), which is
 * why it is not in Postgres.
